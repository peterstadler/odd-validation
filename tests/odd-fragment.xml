Dad can't fix it at the moment, and we can't afford to buy a new one. I would write to him, but he didn't tell me the address of the villa he was staying in. If only I had a mobile, I could phone his mobile number. Eureka!!! I could use next <choice>

  <p>Goodness me, this phone box stinks. EEAW, I don't even want to know what that is. Anyway, I hope his phone is switched on. What's it again??? Oh, yeah 1312632. Arrgh!! <choice>

  <p>I've been thinking for ages about what to do. There only seems to be one good option, fix and stop all the <choice>
    <sic>polution</sic>
    <corr>pollution</corr>
  </choice>. This sort of seems like a dream, but a fun dream. I'll just have to find out where the city's power source is. <delSpan hand="#HR" resp="#TBE" rend="crossout" spanTo="#delEnd"/> But I've got to go outside (again).</p>
  <p>It was <choice>
    <sic>alot</sic>

  <p>Everything has gone dark and I can't see where I'm going. I keep on banging into long bars and wires and knobs. Yess!! The door!!! <unclear reason="erasure" hand="#HR" resp="#TBE"><gap hand="#HR" unit="cm" extent="2,5"/>I got out.</unclear></p>
  <p>There is uproar outside. I sealed the door with stones on the ground so no one could get <subst hand="#HR" resp="#TBE">
    <del rend="overwritten">it</del>
    <add>in</add>
  </subst> to turn the switch back on.</p>
  <p>I've been thinking. If I'm going to suck out all the <choice>

    <corr>pollution</corr>
  </choice> I'm going to need help. Which is not going to be easy. <unclear reason="erasure" hand="#HR" resp="#TBE"><gap hand="#HR" unit="cm" quantity="2"/> cafe</unclear></p>
  <p>Everyone keeps on staring at me. It's very annoying. I hope people will help!</p>
  <p>OK. I think this will work. I've put up posters everywhere. They say... <quote>MEETING BESIDE PHONE BOX BE THERE AT 2pm</quote>. I hope they read <choice>
